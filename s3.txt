S3 - Simple Storage Service, provides developers and IT teams with secure, durable, highly-scalable, flat object storage.
- Object-based storage:
--- Key
--- Value
--- Version ID
--- Metadata
--- Subresources:
--- --- Access Control Lists
--- --- Torrent
- Unlimited storage
- Files can be 0 Bytes to 5 Terrabytes
- Files stored in buckets (basically just folders/logical separation)
- Bucket names have to be unique globally
- Successful upload will receive HTTP200 code
- Read after Write consistency for PUTS of new objects
- Eventual Consistency for overwrite PUTS and DELETES (can take some time)
- Built for 99.99% availability
- Amazon guarantees 99.999999999% durability (unlikely to ever lose a file)
- Tiered storage available
- Lifecycle management
- Versioning
- Encryption
- Secure your data using Access Control Lists and Bucket Policies


S3 Storage Tiers
- S3 Standard:
--- 99.99% available, 99.999999999% durable
- S3 IA (Infrequently Accessed):
--- Data that is accessed less often, but requires rapid access. Lower fee than S3 but charged retrieval fee.
- S3 One Zone IA:
--- Lower-cost option for IA but doesn't require multiple AZ resiliance
- Glacier:
--- Super cheap, used for archival only. Retrieval time takes 3-5 hours


S3 Charges
- Storage
- Requests
- Storage Management Pricing (tags)
- Data Transfer Pricing (cross-region replication)
- Transfer Accelleration - fast transfers over long distances using CloudFront


S3 Versioning
- Stores all versions of an object (even if you delete an object)
- Once enabled, versioning cannot be disabled, only suspended
- Integrates with Lifecycle rules
- Versioning's MFA Delete capability, which uses MFA, can be used to provide additional layer of security


S3 Cross Region Replication
- Versioning must be enabled on both the source and destination buckets
- Regions must be unique
- Files in an existing bucket are not replicated automatically, all new and updated files will be replicated automatically
- You cannot replicate multiple buckets or daisy chain replication
- Delete markers are replicated
- Deleted individual versions or markers will not be replicated


S3 Lifecycle Management
- Can be used with versioning
- Can be applied to current and previous versions
- Transition to IA after 30 days is possible
- Archive to Glacier after 30 days is possible
- Can permanently delete after N days


S3 Security & Encryption
- All newly created buckets are private by default
- You can setup access control for buckets using bucket policies and ACL
- Buckets can be configured to create access logs which log requests made to the bucket.
- Methods of Encryption
--- In Transit
--- --- SSL/TLS
--- At Rest
--- --- Server Side
--- --- --- S3 Manged Keys SSE-S3
--- --- --- AWS Key Management Service, Manged Keys SSE-KMS
--- --- --- Server Side Encryption with Customer Provided Keys SSE-C
--- --- Client Side Encryption

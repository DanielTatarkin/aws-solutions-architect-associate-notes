Elastic File System (EFS) - file storage service for EC2 instances.
- Supports NFSv4
- only pay for storage used
- can scale up to petabytes
- supports thousands of concurrent NFS connections
- multiple EC2 can point to the same EFS
- data is stored across multiple AZ's within a region. 
- read after write consistency
- can restrict permission to file level or directory level
- can't mount an EFS in multiples VPC; only one at a time
- uses port 2049 (NFS)
-- file system and VPC must be in the same REGION 
- Two types:
-- General purpose: low latency
-- Max IO: higher latency, but useful for big data

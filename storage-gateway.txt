Storage Gateway - Service that connects an on-premise software appliance with cloud-based storage to provide seamless and secure integration between an organizations IT environment and AWS storage infrastructure.

Types of Storage Gateways
- File Gateway (NFS)
- Volumes Gateway (iSCSI)
--- Stored Volumes
--- Cached Volumes
- Tape Gateway (VTL)

File Gateway - Files are stored as objects in your S3 buckets, accessed through NFS mount point. Once files are transferred they can be managed as native S3 objects.
Volume gateway - Presents your applications with disk volumes using iSCSI block protocol.
--- Can be asynchronously backed up as point-in-time snapshots of your volumes
--- Stored in cloud as EBS snapshots
--- Stored Volumes
--- --- Store entire copy locally, asynchronouslybackup to AWS. Complete copy of data kept on-site.
--- Cached Volumnes
--- --- S3 is primary data storage and store only most recent copy locally. Don't need large storage arrays locally.
Tape Gateway - Durabled, cost-effective solution to use existing tape-based backup solution, virtual tapes are sent to and stored in S3.



Exam Study Notes
File Gateway - for flat files, stored directly on S3
Volume Gateway:
- Stored Volumes - Entire dataset stored onsite and async backed up to S3
- Cached Volumes - Entire dataset stored in S3 and most recent data cached onsite
Gateway Virtual tape Library (VTL):
- Used for backup and uses popular backup applications like NetBackup, Backup Exec, Veeam, etc.

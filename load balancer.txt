Load Balancers

Two types of Load Balancers:

- Application load balancer (http / https level)
- Classic Network load balancer (TCP))

Can be external (accesible via internet) or internal (balancing backend instances behind a subnet, for example)

Performs health checks
- Unhealthy threadhold: number of consecutive checks failed
- Healthy threadhold: number of consecutive OK to consider healthy 

Load balancers only have HOSTNAMES, not IP address. This is because if a AZ goes down, it can move to another without problems

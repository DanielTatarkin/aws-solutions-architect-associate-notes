10,000-foot Overview

Exam Tips
Know EC2 Pricing Models
- On Demand
--- Pay by the second or hour
- Reserved
--- Reserve capacity, contracts are from 12-36 months
- Spot
--- Set a bid price and if spot price meets your bid it will be provisioned
--- Instances terminated when spot price goes out of range
--- won't be charged if AWS terminates instance, but you will be charged if you terminate it
- Dedicated Hosts
--- Used when licensing or multi-tenate is an issue

Know EC2 Instace Types
- (FIGHT DR MCPX)

Know EBS
- Storage Types
--- SSD, General Purpose GP2 (up to 10,000 IOPS, less than 500 MiB/sec)
--- SSD, Provisioned IOPS IO1 (MOre than 10,000 IOPS, more than 500 MiB/sec)
--- HDD, Throughput Optimized ST1 (frequently accessed workloads)
--- HDD, Magnetic Standard (cheap, infrequently accessed storage)
- Cannot mount EBS Volume to multiple EC2 instances; use EFS instead
- Termination Protection is turned off by default, you must turn it on
- On EBS-backed instance, default action is for the root EBS volume to be deleted when the instance is terminated
- EBS Root volumes of your DEFAULT AMI's cannot be encrypted (but third party tools can be used to encrypt)
- EBS Volumes can also be copied and then encrypted at that time
- Additional volumes can be encrypted

Know Volumes Vs Snapshots
- Volumes exist on EBS, virtual hard disk in the cloud
- Snapshots exist on S3
- You can take a snapshot of a volume, the snapshot will be stored on S3
- Snapshots are point-in-time copies of volumes
- Snapshots are incremental
- First snapshot takes a while
- Security
--- Snapshots of encrypted volumes are encrypted automatically
--- Volumes restored from encrypted snapshots are encrypted automatically
--- Snapshots can be shared, but only if they are not encrypted
- Snapshots of ROOT Device Volumes
--- Stop instances before taking snapshot of ROOT volume
- EBS Vs. Instance Store (Ephemeral Storage)
--- Instance Store volumes cannot be stopped
--- If underlying host in Instance Store fails, you lose your data
--- EBS can be stopped
--- Both can be rebooted, you won't lose your data
--- Both will be deleted on termination, but EBS offers option to keep
- Snapshotting RAID Array
--- Freeze the file system
--- Unmount RAID Array
--- Shutdown EC2 Instance

Know Amazon Machine Images (AMI)
- Regional, but can be copied to other regions

Know CloudWatch (monitoring)
- Standard (5minutes)
- Detailed (1minute)
- CloudWatch is for performance monitoring
- Unlike CloudTrail, which is for auditing AWS
- Dashboards
- Alarms
- Events
- Logs

Know Roles
- More secure than storing access key and secret access keys on instances
- Easier to Manage
- Can be assigned to EC2 instance AFTER provisioning
- Universal to region

Know Instance Meta-data
- Used to get information about an instance
- curl http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/
- curl http://169.254.169.254/latest/user-data/

Know EFS Features
- Supports NFSv4 protocol
- Only pay for storage used
- Can scale to petabytes
- Can support thousands of concurrent NFS connections
- Data stored across multiple AZ's
- Read After Write Consistency

Know Lambda
- Event-driven compute service
- Compute service, run code in response to requests

Know Placement Groups (assume clustered is implied, if not mentioned)
- Clustered Placement Groups
--- Always in one AZ, used for Big Data (low latency, high throughput)
- Spread Placement Groups
--- Important EC2 instance on separate hardware

KNOW Elastic Container Service (ECS)

S3 Exam Tips
- S3 is object-based
- Files can be 0B to 5TB
- Unlimited storage
- Files are stored in Buckets
- Universal namespace, names must be unique
- Read after Write consistency for PUTS of new objects
--- Immediately able to read object
- Eventual Consistency for overwrite PUTS and DELETES (take time to propogate)
--- If you update object and then try to read you may get the old object
- Writing to S3 returns HTTP200 for successful write
- Loading files is faster when multipart upload is enabled


Route53 exam tips
- You can only resolve an ELB by going to it's DNS name
- ELB never has IPv4 address, only DNS names
- Understand difference between Alias Record and CName Record
- Given the choice, always choose Alias Record over a CName Record
- Understand routing policies and their use cases

VPC exam tips
- Think of VPC as logical datacenter in AWS
- Consists of IGW's (or virtual private gateways), route tables, NACL's, Subnets, Security Groups
- 1 subnet = 1 AZ
- Security Groups are stateful; NACL's are Stateless
- NO TRANSITIVE PEERING


Load balancer tips
- 3 types of Load Balancers
--- Application Load Balancers (layer 7)
--- Network Load Balancers (layer 4)
--- Classic Load Balancers (layer 7 and layer 4)
- 504 means the gateway has timed out. This means the application not responding within the idle timeout period.
--- Troubleshoot. Is it the web server or the database server?
- If you need IPv4 address of end user, look for the X-Forwarded-For header
- Instances monitored by ELB are reported as InService or OutofService
- Healthcecks instance by talking to it
- ELB'as have their own DNS name

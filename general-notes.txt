Exam Blue Print
- I will be taking new 2018 exam (old exam retired in July 2018)


10,000-foot Overview
----------------------

AWS Global Infrastructure
*You will never be tested on numbers (e.g. number of regions/availability zones)*

Region - Geographical area; Each reach consists of two or more availability zones (AZ)
Availability Zone - Data Center. In a region, but far enough apart to survive natural disasters but within the same region. Places resources in multiple AZ's in the event of a disaster.

North America Regions:
- US East (Northern Virginia)
- US East (Ohio) Region
- US West (Oregon) Region
- US West (Northern California) Region
- AWS GovCloud (US-West Region)
- Canada (Central)

Edge Locations - Endpoints for AWS used for caching content (e.g. Cloudfront). There are many more Edge Locations than Regions.

:::Notes before the exam:::
- I need to understand the difference between Region, Availability Zone, and Edge Location.

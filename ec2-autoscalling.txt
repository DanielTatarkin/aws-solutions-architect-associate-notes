AutoScalling

Launch configuration on Autoscalling group -> Choose AMI
Can't change the AMI ID, it's chosen on creation

Grace period: time that takes an instance to warm up. Will starts the checks after this period.

You can find load logs related to autoscalling in
- Cloudwatch (metrics)
- Access logs
- Request tracing
- Cloud trail logs

How to register a LB group?
- Instance Id
- IP Address of the instance

3 ways to scale the servers
- Manual Scalling
- Dynamic scalling
-- In Target Tracking Scalling, you select a metric and set a target value, and EC2 Autoscalling sets the Cloudwatch Alarms to trigger the scalling based on the metric that you set (or as close as possible)
-- Step scaling allows you to "step up" the number of servers (IE, add 2, add another 2, add another 2, etc), depending on the alarm breach
-- Simple scaling increases the current capacity of the group based on a single scaling adjustement. If you can, use step scaling even if you have a single metric.
- Scheduled scalling
-- You can predict the load changes and how long you need it to run (IE, add 2 more servers between 9am and 12pm from Monday to Friday)

Identity Access Management (IAM) - Allows you to manage users and their level of access to the AWS Console.
- Centralized control of AWS account
- Shared access to AWS account
- Granular permissions
- Identify Federation (AD, FB, LinkedIn, etc.)
- Multifactor Authentication
- Provide temporary access for users/devices/services
- Allows you to setup password rotation policy
- Integrates with many services
- Supports PCI DSS Compliance

Critical Terms
Users - End users
Groups - Collection of users under one set of permissions (Admins, HR, etc.)
Roles - Create roles and assign them to AWS resources (i.e. giving EC2 instance role for writing to EC2)
Policies - Document that defines one or more permissions. Apply policies to users, groups, and roles

IAM does not use region concept. 

You can create cross-acount roles (ie, you hire a company to do audit, the user that you provide to the auditor can be cross-account)

Never use your root account for daily base. ALWAYS create new users

Remember: Add user confirmation window (where the security and access key is shown) is only displayed ONCE. If you lose access, you will have to regenerate the keys.

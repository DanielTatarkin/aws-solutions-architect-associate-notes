Security Token Service (SKS)

Grants users limited and temporary access to AWS services
- Federation (tipically Active Directory) -- No need to create IAM accounts. Sigle sign on the AWS console. Combile users from 1 domain with users from another domain
- Federation with mobile apps - FB, AMZ, Google or other OpenID providers
- Cross Account Access: users from other AWS accounts

Identity Broker: Service that allows to take identity from A and join it (federate it) to B. Impersonate.

Identity Store: FB, Google, Active Directory, etc, all store the identity.

Identity: the user itself.

-------------

Identity broker needs to be programmed.
The temp token returned by IAM Policy is valid between 1 to 36 hours
STS returns 4 values if sucessfull:
1) access key
2) secret access key
3) token
4) duration

Steps:
1 - Develop identity broken to communicate with LDAP & AWS
2 - Identity broker (IB) *ALWAYS* authenticate with LDAP first, then AWS STS
3 - App gets temporary access to AWS Resources

SAML: Secure Assertive Markup Language

Web Identity Federation with mobile apps: you can auth app using things like FB, you need to code it of course

ARN: Amazon Resource Name

AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity: You need to call this method after auth with FB. After that you can access the AWS resouces.

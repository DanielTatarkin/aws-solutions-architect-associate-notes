AWS BASICS

AWS Global Infrastructure
*You will never be tested on numbers (e.g. number of regions/availability zones)*

Region 
	-> Geographical (Brazil, Europe, Asia, etc)). Each region consists of two or more availability zones (AZ). It's not in the same phisical space (if a flooding occurs, other data center can still answer)
Availability zone -> Data center

North America Regions:
- US East (Northern Virginia)
- US East (Ohio) Region
- US West (Oregon) Region
- US West (Northern California) Region
- AWS GovCloud (US-West Region)
- Canada (Central)

Edge Locations -> CDN (content delivery network). They add new ones all the times, over 100 so far. There are many more Edge Locations than Regions.

VPC
- Logically isloated section of the AWS Cloud where you can launch AWS resources in a virtual network that you define.
- Virtual Data Center in the cloud
- Amazon provides you a default VPC in every region when you create your account
- Can create hardware VPN between corporate datacenter and your VPC, make AWS your extension

What can be done:
- Launch instances into sugnet of choice
- Assign custom IP address range to each subnet
- Configure route tables between subnets
- Create internet gateway and attach it to our VPC, one per VPC
- Better security control over AWS resources
- Instance security groups
- Subnet Access Control Lists (ACLs)

Default VPC Vs. Custom VPC
- Default VPC is user friendly, allows you to immediately deply
- All subnets in default VPC have a route out to the internet
- Each EC2 instance has public and private IP address

VPC Peering
- Allows you to connect one VPC with another via a direct network route using private IP Addresses
- Instances behave as if they were on the same private network
- You can peer VPC's with other AWS accounts as well as with other VPC's in same account
- Peering is in star configuration: 1 central VPC peer with 4 others---no transitive peering

Exam Tips
- Think of VPC as logical datacenter in AWS
- Consists of IGW's (or virtual private gateways), route tables, NACL's, Subnets, Security Groups
- 1 subnet = 1 AZ
- Security Groups are stateful; NACL's are Stateless
- NO TRANSITIVE PEERING

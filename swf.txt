SWF (Simple WorkFlow)

Worklow system

Actor:
  		application to start/initiate workflow
  			could be website or mobile app, for example

Worker: program/person that interacts with WF
		Get task
		Process recieved task
		Return result
		
Decider:
		control coordination tasks
		Ordering, concurrency, scheduling
		
A task is designated once and never duplicated

Domain:
	Container where your WF runs
	Isolate set of types, executions, and task lists from others in same account
	Format: JSON
	
A workflow can run for ONE YEAR (measures in seconds)

Difference between SQS and SWF

SWF:
	* Task oriented API
	* Task runs 1 (never duplicated)
	* Keeps track tasks and events
	* Human interaction if needed (ie, "Pick item from the storage")

SQS
	* Message oriented API
	* Message might be duplicated
	* Implement manual app tracking

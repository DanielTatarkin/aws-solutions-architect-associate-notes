--- default routing policy when you create a new record set. Most commonly used when you have a single resource that performs a given function for your domain (e.g. one web server that serves content for violetfamily.com)
- Weighted
--- allows you to split your traffic based on different weights assigned
- Latency
--- allows you to route your traffic based on the lowest latency for your end user (region with fastest response time)

- Failover
- Geolocation

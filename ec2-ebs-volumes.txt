Volumes & Snapshots
- Volumes exist on EBS
--- Virtual Hard Disk
- Snapshots exist on S3
- Snapshots are point in time copies of Volumes
- Snapshots are incremental - only blocks that have changed since your lat snapshot are saved

Snapshots of Root Device Volumes
- Can create AMI's from Volumes and Snapshots
- Can change volume sizes on the fly, including size and storage type
- Always in the same AZ as the EC2 instance
- To move EC2 volume from one AZ/Reg to another, take snap or image of it, copy it to new AZ Region, then create EC2 instance

Encryption
- To encrypt root volume, you need to create an AMI image of your boot disk first, OR use a third party software to encrypt
 
Voumes Vs Snapshots - Security
- Snaps of encrypted volumes are encrypted automatically
- Volumes restored from encrypted snaps are encrypted automatically
- You can share snapshots only if they are unencrypted
--- Snaps can be shared with other AWS accounts or made public

Default option is to delete volume when instance is terminated

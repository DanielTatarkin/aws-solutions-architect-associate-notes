Volumes & Snapshots
- Volumes exist on EBS
--- Virtual Hard Disk
- Snapshots exist on S3
- Snapshots are point in time copies of Volumes
- Snapshots are incremental - only blocks that have changed since your lat snapshot are saved

Snapshots of Root Device Volumes
- Can create AMI's from Volumes and Snapshots
- Can change volume sizes on the fly, including size and storage type. If you change a Volume on the fly, you have to wait 6 hours to change it again. Can't change volume type of Magnetic Std HD
- Volumes MUST BE in the same AZ as the EC2 instance
- If you need to restore/move a EBS Volume to another AZ, you need to create a snapshot of the volume, and create a new volume based on that snapshot, in the other AZ

Encryption
- To encrypt root volume, you need to create an AMI image of your boot disk first, OR use a third party software to encrypt
 
Voumes Vs Snapshots - Security
- Snaps of encrypted volumes are encrypted automatically
- Volumes restored from encrypted snaps are encrypted automatically
- You can share snapshots only if they are unencrypted
--- Snaps can be shared with other AWS accounts or made public

Default option is to delete volume when instance is terminated. Can be turned off in EC2 settings

EBS Volumes only scale up; can't shrink in size
